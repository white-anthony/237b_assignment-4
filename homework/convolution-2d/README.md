# Convolution 2D
![Convolution](https://docs-cse160.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/2D_Convolution_Animation.gif "Convolution")

## Objective
The lab’s objective is to implement a tiled image convolution using both shared and constant memory. We will have a constant $5 \times 5$ convolution mask, but will have arbitrarily sized image (assume the image dimensions are greater than $5 \times 5$ for this Lab).

To use the constant memory for the convolution mask, you can first transfer the mask data to the device. Consider the case where the pointer to the device array for the mask is named $M$. You can use `__constant float * M` as one of the parameters during your kernel launch. This informs the compiler that the contents of the mask array are constants and will only be accessed through pointer variable `M`. This will enable the compiler to place the data into constant memory and allow the SM hardware to aggressively cache the mask data at runtime.

Convolution is used in many fields, such as image processing for image filtering. A standard image convolution formula for a $5 \times 5$ convolution filter $M$ with an Image $I$ is:

$$
P_{i,j,c} = \sum^2_{x=-2} \sum^2_{y=-2} I_{i+x,j+y,c} * M_{x,y}
$$

where $P_{i,j,c}$ is the output pixel at position $i,j$ in channel $c$, $I_{i,j,c}$ is the input pixel at $i,j$ in channel $c$ (the number of channels will always be 3 for this PA corresponding to the RGB values), and $M_{x,y}$ is the mask at position $x,y$.

## Input Data

The input is an interleaved image of `height x width x channels`. By interleaved, we mean that the the element `I[y][x]` contains three values representing the RGB channels. This means that to index a particular element’s value, you will have to do something like:

```
index = (yIndex*width + xIndex)*channels + channelIndex;
```

For this assignment, the channel index is 0 for R, 1 for G, and 2 for B. So, to access the G value of `I[y][x]`, you should use the linearized expression `I[(yIndex*width+xIndex)*channels + 1]`.

For simplicity, you can assume that `channels` is always set to 3.

### Instructions

Edit the code in the code tab to perform the following:

* Allocate device memory
* Copy host memory to device
* Initialize thread block and kernel grid dimensions 16x16
* Invoke OpenCL kernel
* Copy results from device to host
* Deallocate device memory
* Implement the tiled 2D convolution kernel with adjustments for channels
* Use shared memory to reduce the number of global accesses, handle the boundary conditions in when loading input list elements into the shared memory

Instructions about where to place each part of the code is demarcated by the `//@@` comment lines.

### Psuedo Code

A sequential pseudo code would look something like this:

```
maskWidth := 5
maskRadius := maskWidth/2 # this is integer division, so the result is 2
for i from 0 to height do
    for j from 0 to width do
        for k from 0 to channels
            accum := 0
            for y from -maskRadius to maskRadius do
                for x from -maskRadius to maskRadius do
                    xOffset := j + x
                    yOffset := i + y
                    if xOffset >= 0 && xOffset < width &&
                        yOffset >= 0 && yOffset < height then
                        imagePixel := I[(yOffset * width + xOffset) * channels + k]
                        maskValue := K[(y+maskRadius)*maskWidth+x+maskRadius]
                        accum += imagePixel * maskValue
                    end
                end
            end
            # pixels are in the range of 0 to 1
            P[(i * width + j)*channels + k] = clamp(accum, 0, 1)
        end
    end
end
```

where `clamp` is defined as

```
def clamp(x, lower, upper)
    return min(max(x, lower), upper)
end
```

### How to Compile

The `main.c` and `kernel.cl` file contains the code for the programming assignment. There is a `Makefile `included which compiles it. It can be run by typing make from the `convolution-2d` folder. It generates a solution output file. During development, make sure to run the `make clean` command before running `make`.

### How to Test

Use the `make run` command to test your program. There are a total of 10 tests on which your program will be evaluated for (functional) correctness.
